The Galileo Correspondence Project will have two published outcomes: a scholarly monograph, provisionally titled Galileo's Letters: Experiments in Friendship, about science, silence, friendship, and collegiality as seen through Galileo's correspondence, and a digitally published enriched database of the metadata and content of Galileo's letters.  This database will be a fundamental tool, a new kind of scholarly edition, that will promote further digital humanities analysis and research on this important source base.

- (Forthcoming) Paula Findlen and Hannah Marcus, "The Breakdown of Galileo's Roman Network: Crisis and Community, c. 1633", accepted for publication in Social Studies of Science.
- (In progress) Hannah Marcus and Paula Findlen, "Deciphering Galileo," to be submitted to a journal in February 2016.
