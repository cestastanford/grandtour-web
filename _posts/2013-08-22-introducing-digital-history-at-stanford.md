Welcome to Digital History at Stanford! The site exists to showcase the working being done in digital history in the Department of History at Stanford University as well as provide resources on workshops, courses, and readings for faculty and students interested in incorporating digital methods into their work. 

Over the coming weeks, new resources will be added to the site and will remain an evolving resource for digital history. The site will announce any new items that are added. You can also follow the Digital History at Stanford Twitter stream at [@StanfordDH](http://twitter.com/stanforddh).
