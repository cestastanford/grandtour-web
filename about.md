In the eighteenth century travelers from north of the Alps flocked to Italy, for “the most interesting of all possible voyages,” as the Abbé Gabriel-François Coyer put it after his own journey in 1763.[1] Dotted with the monuments that northern cultural and social élites knew from their readings of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and populated by influential contemporaries who might be encountered in the flesh, the Italian peninsula held out the promise of an educational rite of passage rooted in humanist ideals of classical origins. The story of the “Grand Tour,” as this journey was known, is the story of nations as well as of individuals, and as such it holds enormous cultural and historiographical significance today. To study it, to think about its participants and to re-create their pathways, is to encounter an increasingly diffused learned community whose travels helped shape the modern world as we know it. This was a community of travelers consisting of the Enlightenment’s most sensitive minds and influential writers, of reluctant youths and intrepid women, of scientists and artists – the crossing of all of whose paths led to exchanges and interactions that contributed to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of practices of professionalism.

Yet the Grand Tour also poses an historiographical challenge. Our grasp on it today is constrained by the documents, widely dispersed, through which we can know it. Not that there is any shortage of texts in existence that can tell us about the Tour: many travelers kept journals and wrote letters, of which a number were published; and these published “travels” were themselves shaped not just by ancient texts but also by previous travelers’ accounts. Yet even these texts account for the travels of only a fraction of those who voyaged to the peninsula in these years. So while it is understood that the Grand Tour was a widespread phenomenon, with numerous individuals traveling across a vast geography, and that this long reach is a crucial feature of its influence, the fact remains that we barely glimpse its totality when we define and understand it through the writings of only a small selection of travelers. As we swim in the catchy, oft-reproduced quotations of the Grand Tour’s most prominent participants, we remain blind to the actual numbers that constitute its formative impact on modernity.



Our digitizing and visualizing approach to “Mapping the Grand Tour” begins to address this nagging historiographical problem. By digitizing and visualizing John Ingamells’ 1997 prosopographical Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy 1701-1800, we cast an unusually wide net, bringing into the picture more than five thousand travelers, who together represent a diverse scope of touristic experiences
