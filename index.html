  The Galileo correspondence is one of the most important and complex scientific correspondences of the early modern era. The letters have a complicated archival history, involving multiple episodes of both intentional suppression and accidental loss of key documents.  We are experimenting with digital methods to reconstruct and read this archive and then using those techniques to develop and publish new perspectives on Galileo as a writer and recipient of letters, scientific and otherwise, who pioneered the use of epistolary as a primary means of communicating controversial ideas and observations.
