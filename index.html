  The Grand Tour of Italy attracted thousands of Europeans throughout the eighteenth century. It was a formative institution of modernity, contributing to a massive reimagining of politics and the arts, of the market for culture, of ideas about leisure, and of practices of professionalism. <font color="darkred"><em> The Grand Tour Project</em></font color>, directed at Stanford by Giovanna Ceserani, enriches our understanding of this phenomenon by bringing us closer to the diverse travelers, elite and otherwise, who collectively constituted its world. We are working with the more than five thousand entries in John Ingamells’ <em>Dictionary of British and Irish Travelers to Italy</em> to create a dynamic searchable database, along with digital visualizations, of these travelers’ journeys and lives. On this website you can read about our work on the Grand Tour Project and learn about some of its capabilities and anticipated outcomes.
