This coming March the Grand Tour Project is hosting an international scholarly workshop:

<center><strong>
Digitizing the Grand Tour:

a workshop on the worlds and lives of eighteenth-century travelers to Italy.
</strong></center>

This workshop will take place on Friday March 4th and Saturday March 5th 2016, in the Board Room at the Stanford Humanities Center, starting both days at 10:30 am.

We are excited to bring to Stanford and to involve in our project some of the most renowned scholars of the Grand Tour and of eighteenth-century cultural history. The multidisciplinary character of the Grand Tour is reflected by the varied disciplinary expertise of the invited outside participants:

> Malcolm Baker (UC Riverside), John Brewer (Caltech), Melissa Calaresu (Cambridge), Jeffrey Collins (Bard NYC), Paul Davis (Princeton), Simon Macdonald (EUI Florence), Carole Paul (UCSB), Sophus Reinhert (Harvard), Catherine Sama (Rhode Island), Rosemary Sweet (Leicester)

Speakers will present new research on the eighteenth-century Grand Tour of Italy while engaging to varying degrees with the interactive database that we have been developing. 

Final workshop program coming soon.
