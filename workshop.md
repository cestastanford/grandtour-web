In March 2016, we are excited to bring to Stanford and to involve in our project some of the most renowned scholars of the Grand Tour and of eighteenth-century cultural history. The multidisciplinary character of the Grand Tour is reflected by the varied disciplinary expertise of the invited outside participants. The speakers will present new research on the eighteenth-century Grand Tour of Italy while engaging to varying degrees with the interactive database that we have been developing. Here are the program and announcement for further dissemination:
